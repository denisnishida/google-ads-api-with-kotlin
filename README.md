# google-ads-api-with-kotlin
Simple app to learn creation of ads with Google Ads API and Kotlin language

For this application I will use:
- A test Google Ads account (instructions here: https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/accounts-overview#test_accounts);
- IntelliJ IDEA that comes with the Kotlin language.
